## Run BobaEditor Locally

In a terminal on your own machine, enter the local directory where you want to keep your copy of BobaEditor, then run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the codebase from github
git clone https://github.com/essential-randomness/boba-editor.git
# Enter the codebase directory
cd boba-editor
# Install all necessary code
yarn install
```

Making it easier and more accessible to start contributing is an ongoing process. If there's something you think would lower the barrier of entry to contribution, [we encourage you to suggest it](https://github.com/essential-randomness/bobadocs/issues).

## Installing BobaEditor

While you're welcome to experiment with integrating BobaEditor into your own projects, it's currently at an unstable phase of active development. We're not currently following proper semantic release and the specifications may change unpredictably as the BobaBoard platform evolves. 

Given that, if you're still interested in using BobaEditor at your own risk, please reach out to @essential-randomness so she can take that into account. You can install it with `yarn add @bobaboard/boba-editor` or `npm install @bobaboard/boba-editor`.
